# About
This repository contains the code for my Masters by Research (MPhil) codebase. 
It contains python scripts and notebooks that I used to make a number of plots for both my paper (see below) and my thesis. As such, this repository is a bit of a jumbled mess.

**The paper is currently in the pre-print stage. it has only been submitted to PASA and has yet to be peer-reviewed.**

# Contents
The folder `/LUMFUNCS` contains the code used to create and generate luminosity functions as seen in *[Lyon et al, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08541)*. `/scripts` contains many random files and notebooks that *may* be of some use.

`/EAZY` ([EAZY](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...686.1503B/abstract)) and `/CIGALE` ([CIGALE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.103B/abstract)) are two SED decomposition software packages that I have installed here because I found them to be a pain to setup on different devices.
<!-- - `/DATA` contains the ZFOURGE and CIGALE (Ollie) raw data files. -->
